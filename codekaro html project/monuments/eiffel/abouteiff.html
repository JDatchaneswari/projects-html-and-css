			<h4>CONSTRUCTION</h4>
			<div>The plan to build a tower 300 metres high was conceived as part of preparations for the World's Fair of 1889.The wager was to "study the possibility of erecting an iron tower on the Champ-de-Mars with a square base, 125 metres across and 300 metres tall". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect, that was accepted.Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in Eiffel's company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884. It was to be designed like a large pylon with four columns of lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at the top, and joined to each other by more metal girders at regular intervals.The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000 feet. On September 18 1884 Eiffel registered a patent "for a new configuration allowing the construction of metal supports and pylons capable of exceeding a height of 300 metres".In order to make the project more acceptable to public opinion, Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned the architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the project's appearanceSauvestre proposed stonework pedestals to dress the legs, monumental arches to link the columns and the first level, large glass-walled halls on each level, a bulb-shaped design for the top and various other ornamental features to decorate the whole of the structure. In the end the project was simplified, but certain elements such as the large arches at the base were retained, which in part give it its very characteristic appearance.The curvature of the uprights is mathematically determined to offer the most efficient wind resistance possible.All the metal pieces of the tower are held together by rivets, a well-refined method of construction at the time the Tower was constructed. First the pieces were assembled in the factory using bolts, later to be replaced one by one with thermally assembled rivets, which contracted during cooling thus ensuring a very tight fit. A team of four men was needed for each rivet assembled: one to heat it up, another to hold it in place, a third to shape the head and a fourth to beat it with a sledgehammer. Only a third of the 2,500,000 rivets used in the construction of the Tower were inserted directly on site.<br><br>

            <div> As Eiffel himself explains: "All the cutting force of the wind passes into the interior of the leading edge uprights. Lines drawn tangential to each upright with the point of each tangent at the same height, will always intersect at a second point, which is exactly the point through which passes the flow resultant from the action of the wind on that part of the tower support situated above the two points in question. Before coming together at the high pinnacle, the uprights appear to burst out of the ground, and in a way to be shaped by the action of the wind".The assembly of the supports began on July 1, 1887 and was completed twenty-two months later.All the elements were prepared in Eiffel’s factory located at Levallois-Perret on the outskirts of Paris. Each of the 18,000 pieces used to construct the Tower were specifically designed and calculated, traced out to an accuracy of a tenth of a millimetre and then put together forming new pieces around five metres each. A team of constructors, who had worked on the great metal viaduct projects, were responsible for the 150 to 300 workers on site assembling this gigantic erector set.It only took five months to build the foundations and twenty-one to finish assembling the metal pieces of the Tower.Considering the rudimentary means available at that period, this could be considered record speed. The assembly of the Tower was a marvel of precision, as all chroniclers of the period agree. The construction work began in January 1887 and was finished on March 31, 1889. On the narrow platform at the top, Eiffel received his decoration from the Legion of Honour.The tower was assembled using wooden scaffolding and small steam cranes mounted onto the tower itself.The assembly of the first level was achieved by the use of twelve temporary wooden scaffolds, 30 metres high, and four larger scaffolds of 40 metres each."Sand boxes" and hydraulic jacks - replaced after use by permanent wedges - allowed the metal girders to be positioned to an accuracy of one millimetre.On December 7, 1887, the joining of the major girders up to the first level was completed. The pieces were hauled up by steam cranes, which themselves climbed up the Tower as they went along using the runners to be used for the Tower's lifts</div>

			<h4>UNKNOWN FACTS</h4>
			<div>
				<h3>1. The Eiffel Tower welcomes millions each year</h3>
<p>The Eiffel Tower has welcomed over 300 million people and still welcomes almost 7 million visitors a year. Quite impressive!</p>
<h3>2. It was built to mark the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution</h3>
<p>Paris hosted the 1889 World’s Fair. Artists from around the nation sent in interesting plans for a structure to mark the entrance to the fair on the Champ-de-Mars.</p>
<h3>3. Eiffel et Compagnie was the firm that designed and built the Eiffel tower</h3>
<p>Gustave Eiffel, a bridge-builder, architect, and metals expert owned this consulting and construction firm. In fact, this wasn’t the first grand project, he also worked in the early 1880s on the Garabit Viaduct, the highest bridge in the world, at the time. Before landing the World’s Fair project, he also helped design the Statue of Liberty.4. It’s a relative to the Statue of Liberty
Eiffel’s company was invited to plan the interior frame for the Statue of Liberty, a task assigned to his right-hand employee, Maurice Koechlin.</p>
<h3>5. The original design was rejected</h3>
<p>After viewing his senior engineer’s design Eiffel felt it was too minimalist and he was instructed to include more details and flourishes in his redesign. The final design was approved in 1884.</p>
<h3>6. Who were the engineers behind the project</h3>
<p>While Eiffel earned the naming rights for the Tower, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier drew the original design teamed up with French architect, Stephen Sauvestre.</p><br>

                 <br>
 <h3>7. Are you up for a climb!</h3>
<p>Another cool fact is that it’s possible to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower.  If you’re feeling very fit, you can climb to the top – beware though – there are 1,665 steps! So most people take the lift.  Little known fact: The Eiffel Tower actually has a total of 5 lifts!  If you plan on using the lift, It costs up to 26,10€ for a ticket to the top.</p>
<h3>8. The building of the Eiffel Tower required tons of metal and manpower</h3>
<p>300 steelworkers spent two years, two months, and five days, from 1887 to 1889, constructing the Tower, using more than 18,000 individual metallic parts, 2.5 million rivets, and 40 tons of paint.</p>
<h3>9. Eiffel’s tower initial height was 985 feet</h3>
<p>In March 1889, upon its completion, the Tower measured 300 meters (985 feet) high. The fact is that this measurement isn’t static, cold weather can shrink the Tower by up to six inches.</p>
<h3>10. It was the tallest structure in the world</h3>
<p>For 41 years, the Eiffel Tower stood higher than any building or structure in the world until in 1930 it was surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York with a height of 1046 feet.</p>
<h3>11. A large committee protested the tower</h3>
<p>Did you know that the author Guy de Maupassant, Alexandre Dumas, Jr., and around 300 other artists and intellectuals, signed a petition opposing the project? They surely did! In fact, they thought the Tower is useless and monstrous.</p>
<h3>12. Nevertheless, the Eiffel Tower was an instant hit</h3>
<p>The Eiffel Tower was visited by nearly 2 million people during the Fair, spending $1.4 million on tickets, making the 1889 World Fair one of the few to actually turn a profit. </p>
