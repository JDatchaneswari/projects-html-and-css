				<h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
				<img src="./Historical Places in our india_files/th" alt="Taj Mahal">
				<p>The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum in the city of Agra, India. It was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653. Today, it is considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and attracts millions of visitors each year.In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the world’s most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983. With its spellbinding beauty and rich historical backdrop, Taj Mahal is                            one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Get acquainted with some essential facts about Taj Mahal if you have planned a visit to this white beauty this vacation.
                           during present times. Most of the money of the king and emperor of the Mughal Dynasty was over constructing the massive architectural marble monument of the Taj Mahal. It took so much expensive construction materials, several kinds of precious stones from around the world, and a massive workforce to built this costly monument.</p>
                        <p><strong>Layout and its Architecture</strong></p>
                        <p>Resting in the middle of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white marble that reflects hues according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight. It has four nearly identical facades, each with a wide central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners incorporating smaller arches. The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) at the tip of its finial, is surrounded by four lesser domes. The acoustics inside the main dome cause the single note of a flute to reverberate five times. The interior of the mausoleum is organized around an octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief carvings and semiprecious stones (pietra dura). Therein are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān. Those false tombs are enclosed by a finely wrought filigree marble screen. Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true sarcophagi. Standing gracefully apart from the central bui                           ilding, at each of the four corners of the square plinth, are elegant minarets.</p>
                        <p><strong>History</strong></p>
                        <p>The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.
                           A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to house his own remains. That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been connected by a bridge to the Taj Mahal. He was deposed in 1658 by his son Aurangzeb, however, and was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra Fort.</p>

				<h2>Qutub Minar</h2>
				<img src="./Historical Places in our india_files/th(1)" alt="Qutub Minar">
				<p>The Qutub Minar is a minaret located in the Qutb complex in Delhi, India. It is made of red sandstone and marble and stands at a height of 73 meters. The construction of the Qutub Minar was started by Qutub-ud-din Aibak in 1192 and was completed by Iltutmish in 1220. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction.The exterior walls of Qutub Minar reveal its history of construction, with chiseled Parso-Arabic and Nagari character carvings. The inscriptions clearly describe the motive, way, the time taken and every minute detail about this monument.</p>		      
                        <p><strong>Layout and Architecture </strong></p>
                        <p>It was ordered that this monument be constructed as a sign of victory and establishment of Muslim rule. So it was to be a grand work of Indo-Islamic architecture and design.The exterior walls of Qutub Minar reveal its history of construction, with chiseled Parso-Arabic and Nagari character carvings. The inscriptions clearly describe the motive, way, the time taken and every minute detail about this monument.
                           From the intricate carvings, you’ll note an aura of Afghanistan pattern, blended with local artistic conventions having garlands and lotus borders. Fortunately, renovations of the minaret throughout time have maintained the original charm of the building.
                           Each of the five different storeys has a projected balcony that circles the Minar (backed by stone brackets). The first three storeys are made with red sandstone while the remaining were constructed using marble and sandstone. If you look closely the cylindrical shaft has inscriptions of the Quran.A number of monuments and buildings that are historically significant and associated with the minaret surround it and the whole area forms part of the Qutb complex. The structures inside the complex include the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the Iron Pillar of Delhi, the Tomb of Imam Zamin, the Tomb of Iltutmish and Major Smith's Cupola among others. 
                           Of these the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque located at the north-east foot of the minaret holds significance as the first mosque that was constructed in India. Commissioned by Aibak, the construction work of the mosque started in 1193 and completed in 1197. This magnificent structure consists of an inner and an outer courtyard ornamented with shafts, most of which were taken from the 27 Hindu temples demolished to build the mosque. A provocative inscription carved over the eastern gate of the mosque records such information manifesting the presence of typical Hindu ornamentation in a Muslim mosque.
                           Another notable attraction inside the Qutb complex is the 7 m (23 ft.) Iron Pillar, a rust-resistant iron column that not only attracts tourists but also draws attention of archaeologists and materials scientists. This pillar from Gupta Empire has Brahmic inscriptions. It is commonly believed that if one can embrace the pillar with both hands while standing with one's back facing the pillar then his/her wish gets fulfilled.   </p>
                        <p><strong>History</strong></p>
                        <p>Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the founder of the Turkish rule in north-western India and also of the Mamluk Dynasty in Delhi commissioned the construction of this monument in 1192 AD. Aibak dedicated the minaret to the Muslim Sufi mystic, saint and scholar of the Chishti Order, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. Different beliefs surround the origin of the minaret. While some sources believe it was constructed as a tower of victory marking the beginning of Muslim dominion in India, some others say it served the muezzins who called the faithful to prayer from the minaret. Uncertainty hovers around naming of the tower with some suggesting it was named after the Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki while others believe it was named after Aibak himself.The tower was completed by Aibak's son-in-law and successor Shams-ud-din Iltutmish, regarded as the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1220. Iltutmish added three more storeys to the monument. This historical monument faced a few natura                           l disasters. A lightning hit the top storey of the minaret in 1369 AD, knocking it off entirely. The then ruler of the Sultanate of Delhi, Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq took charge of its restoration and constructed two more storeys to the minaret made of marble and red sandstone. Again when an earthquake damaged it in 1505, the then Sultan of Delhi, Sikandar Lodi, reconstructed the top two storeys of the minaret with marbles. Parso-Arabic and Nagari characters engraved in various sections of the minaret speak about the history of its construction. The minaret faced the wrath of nature yet again when a major earthquake on September 1, 1803 damaged it severely. In 1828, it was renovated by Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army, who installed a cupola atop the tower. However in 1848, as instructed by the then Governor General of India, Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge, the cupola was uninstalled from the tower and placed in the east of it where the cup                           ola remains situated.</p>

Today, it is a <acronym title="United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</acronym>World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction.<br>
                        The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines <dfn ="the="" indian="" subcontinent's="" islamic="" period="" produced="" architecture="" that="" drew="" stylistically="" from="" persianate="" culture,="" using="" features="" such="" as="" domes,="" iwans,="" minars,="" and="" baghs"="">Persianate palace architecture</dfn> with Indian traditions.</dfn></dfn></p>
                        <p>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.</p>
                        On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.
                        The Red Fort was designated a <acronym title="Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</acronym>World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.<p></p>

                        <p>The World Heritage Convention characterises the Red Fort as representing "the zenith of Mughal creativity". The fort synthesises Islamic palace structure with local traditions, resulting in a confluence of "Persian, Timurid, and <dfn title="It is the traditional system of Indian architecture for structures such as temples, monasteries, statues, homes, market places, gardens and town planning as described in Hindu texts">Hindu Architecture</dfn>.The fort served as an inspiration for later buildings and gardens across the Indian subcontinent.

The fort's artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique Shahjahani style rich in form, expression and colour. Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India encapsulating a long period of history and its arts. Even before its 1913 commemoration as a monument of national importance, efforts were made to preserve it for posterity.
                        The fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.The fort’s massive red sandstone walls, which stand 75 feet (23 metres) high, enclose a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, projecting balconies, baths and indoor canals, and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque. Among the most famous structures of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-ʿAm), which has 60 red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas),which is smaller and has a pavilion of white marble.</p>
                        <p><strong>History of the fort </strong></p><strong><br>

It was named after a peacock as two peacocks are shown dancing at its rear.">peacock throne, which had served as the royal throne of the Mughals.The weakened Mughals had no other option but to sign a treaty with the Marathas, who had promised to protect them and the fort. In 1760, when Ahmed Shah Durrani of the Durrani dynasty threatened to capture Delhi, the Marathas dug out the silver ceiling of Diwan-i-Khas to strengthen their army. However, Ahmed Shah Durrani defeated the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat and took over the fort. The Marathas reco                         red the fort in 1771 and stalled Shah Alam II as the 16th Mughal emperor. In 1788, the Marathas occupied the fort and ruled over Delhi for the next 20 years before the British defeated them during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803.The fort now was occupied by the British, who even built a residence of their own within the fort. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, Bahadur Shah II, was arrested by the British and later exiled to Rangoon. With Bahadur Shah II, the Mughal Empire came to an end and this opened a window of opportunity for the British to loot valuables from the fort. Almost all furniture were either destroyed or shipped to England. Many edifices and landmarks within the fort were destroyed and barracks of stone replaced them. Many priceless possessions like the Koh-i-Noor diamond, the crown of Bahadur Shah and th                         e wine cup of Shah Jahan were sent to the British government. After independence, the Indian Army occupied a maj                         or part of the fort before handing it over to the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India">(ASA)</acronym>for restoration purposes.</in></em> </p>
